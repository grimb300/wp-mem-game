# WordPress Memory Game

Plugin creates a shortcode to add a memory game to any post or page.

## Special Instructions

The original CodePen that this was based on uses Sass. First check if Sass is installed:

```
sass --version
```

If it needs to be installed (using npm, there are other ways to install it):

```
npm install -g sass
```

Then set up the compiler to watch the sass directory:

```
sass --watch assets/sass:assets/css
```
